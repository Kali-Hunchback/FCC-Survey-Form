# Free Code Camp Survey Form Project
Project undertaken as a part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification<br>
**Project 2 of 5**<br>
I was playing a lot of Animal Crossing: New Horizons when I developed this, so it's theme has shone through.<br>
Interesting note for this project was learning to use RGBA to enable opacity shifting to allow background image to appear through the wrappers color
